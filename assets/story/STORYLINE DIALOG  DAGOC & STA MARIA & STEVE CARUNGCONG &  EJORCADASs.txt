A small sparrow flutters down, but its eyes glow with an unnatural light. A voice echoes through the trees.

The Honker: "You think you can catch me, little hunter? My minions will peck you to pieces before you even get close! Let’s see how you fare against the Feathered Beast!"

Suddenly, a massive hawk swoops down, perching on a branch above Arlen, its feathers shimmering with power.

Arlen: (Grimacing) "This swamp reeks… The Honker sure knows how to pick the worst places to hide."

The water ripples, and venomous snakes slither toward him, their fangs bared. A deep croaking laugh echoes through the fog.

The Honker: "You’re persistent, I’ll give you that. But this swamp will be your grave! Say hello to my Bog Guardian!"

A massive toad emerges from the murky depths, its eyes glowing green, and it lets out a guttural croak that shakes the ground.

Bog Guardian: "Trespasser... You will be swallowed whole!"

A whirlwind of sand whips up, forming into a towering sand elemental that hurls itself at Arlen. The ground rumbles as something massive slithers beneath the sand.

The Honker: "Lost in the desert, are you? Perfect! My Sand Serpent will make sure you never leave these dunes alive!"

The Sand Serpent bursts from the sand, its massive coils wrapping around the battlefield.

Sand Serpent: "You are nothing but prey in my domain!"

A massive stone golem rumbles to life, blocking Arlen's path. Its eyes glow with the same eerie light as the cursed spirits surrounding it.

The Honker: "So close, yet so far! These ruins will be your final resting place, hunter. Meet my Guardian of the Ruins!"

The stone giant raises its arms, ready to crush Arlen beneath its massive fists.

Guardian of the Ruins: "You will not disturb the treasures of this land. Leave now or be destroyed."
